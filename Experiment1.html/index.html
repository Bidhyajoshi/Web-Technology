    <p style="font-size: 19px;">Hello! This is my personal website created using basic HTML and CSS.
         I am a B.Tech second-year student at Jain University, currently building my foundation in technology while exploring my passion for web development.

         I work with Python, Java, C, and front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I enjoy creating simple, clean, and interactive web experiences and constantly look for ways to improve my technical skills.

         Technology excites me, and I am always curious to learn how things work behind the scenes. What I may lack in experience, I make up for with my willingness to learn, consistency, and determination.

         Outside of tech, I am a coffee lover — it keeps me energized, focused, and ready to code. ☕
